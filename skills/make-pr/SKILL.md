# make-pr

Use this skill when the work is already done and the user wants a PR created, updated, rewritten, split, or republished, and also whenever a branch, stack, or PR change could leave GitHub title/body/proof text out of date.

Read this skill and `skills/visual-proof/SKILL.md` from the PR's target base branch (for example `git show origin/master:skills/make-pr/SKILL.md`) before authoring proof or PR bodies. Working branches and merge clones can carry stale policy copies, and the validators enforce the base branch's rules.

For stacked PRs, apply `skills/review-compression/SKILL.md` before you write titles or PR bodies. If one branch mixes more than one local review claim, split the stack first.
For decomposition or extraction refactors (splitting a large file into modules), do one refactor at a time: one PR moves exactly ONE top-level symbol. A function move is its own PR; a class moves as one PR with its methods (one top-level symbol, not method-by-method). Create the target file, move that one symbol, re-point references in the same PR, and keep the public surface stable. The next symbol is the next PR. If the symbol depends on a private helper that is not exported, move that minimal helper cluster with it only when splitting them would break the build or force a throwaway shim. Bundling several extractions into one branch ("extract prepare + dispatch + finalize") is the default mistake this rule prevents — see the **Decomposition & Extraction Refactors** section of `skills/review-compression/SKILL.md`.

## Stack ordering

Order slices so a reviewer reads the evidence before the change it justifies (see `skills/review-compression/SKILL.md` → Ordering Rules):

- **Repro/proof comes before the fix.** Land the repro or regression proof as the earlier slice (e.g. `(1)`) and the behavior fix as the later slice (e.g. `(2)`), so the bug is demonstrated before the change is approved.
- Keep each slice green for CI: write the proof to assert the current (buggy) behavior, or mark the unfixed expectation pending (`it.fails` / skip with a TODO); the fix slice then flips it to the corrected behavior.
- Foundation (types, helpers, migrations, flags) precedes behavior; cleanup and docs come last.

## What this skill covers

- PR title/body authoring for Invoker
- The preferred PR section schema
- Upstream-first branch/PR workflow (explicit base and publish remotes)
- Mandatory refresh after branch/PR changes that can stale GitHub metadata
- Repo-specific publication rules:
  - Invoker-on-Invoker stacks may use `mergify stack push`
  - unrelated target repos should keep their own normal PR workflow unless they independently use Mergify Stacks


- For published Mergify stacks, maintain one machine-managed stack comment on every PR in the stack. The comment lists the full stack bottom-to-top and must be refreshed whenever the stack changes.
## Preferred PR schema

Default to this structure:

```md
## Summary

Plain-English explanation of what changed and why.

Write this for a burnt out developer who needs the point quickly.

Use paragraphs, not bullets. Keep each paragraph under 30 words.

Put one idea in each paragraph. If one idea leads to another, split them into separate short paragraphs.

Avoid implementation jargon unless it is necessary for understanding the change.

## Review Claim

State the one thing the reviewer is being asked to approve.

## Review Lane

Choose exactly one: `behavior`, `refactor`, `proof`, `cleanup`, `policy`, or `docs`.

## Review Unit

Choose exactly one matching review unit: `contract`, `ownership-refactor`, `read-path`, `validation-policy`, `write-path`, `routing`, `activation-surface`, `tooling-policy`, `proof`, `docs`, or `cleanup`.

The unit must match the changed files. The CI validator rejects a declared unit that ships files assigned to another unit.

## Safety Invariant

Explain why this slice is safe to review locally.
If the source plan or slice does not contain a user-confirmed safety invariant,
propose one and ask the user to confirm or correct it before publishing this PR
body.

## Slice Rationale

Explain why this work is split here instead of bundled elsewhere.

## Non-goals

List what this slice explicitly does not change.

For a `refactor` lane, include one of these exact claims: `no behavior change`, `behavior unchanged`, `unchanged behavior`, or `pass unchanged`.

## Architecture

Only include this section when the change modifies component interactions, control flow, state flow, or data flow.

Quote Mermaid labels when they contain prose, punctuation, or code-ish text. Safe:

### Before

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["reviewGate.artifacts[] is pending"]
```

Unsafe:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[reviewGate.artifacts[] is pending]
```

### After

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["reviewGate.artifacts[] is published"]
```

## Test Plan

<details>
<summary>Test Plan</summary>

- [ ] exact command
- [ ] exact command
- Not run: <check>. Blocker: <what stops it>

</details>

## Measured

Paste what the repro or benchmark command printed, before and after this change. Write `none: <reason>` instead when the slice has nothing to measure.

Command: `exact command`

### Base

```text
pasted output from the base commit
```

### Head

```text
pasted output from this branch
```

## Visual Proof

Required when the diff changes UI-impacting files. Include before/after screenshots or a video link.

Manually inspected: state exactly what you saw when you opened the image or video yourself, not just that it was captured.

## Revert Plan

<details>
<summary>Revert Plan</summary>

- Safe to revert? Yes/No
- Revert command: `git revert <sha>` or equivalent
- Post-revert steps: None / concrete steps
- Data migration? No / concrete steps

</details>
```

If the change is small and has no architectural impact, omit `## Architecture` rather than forcing filler.

If the change is UI-impacting, use `skills/visual-proof/SKILL.md` first and include its screenshot/video markdown in `## Visual Proof`. UI-impacting means the user-visible experience changes, even when no file under `packages/ui/**` changes. This includes `packages/ui/**`, Electron window lifecycle files, preload, main process window wiring, app menu changes, task status changes, task error or output text shown in panels, approval/reject behavior, workflow state shown in the DAG or inspector, and web-surface output.

For Invoker UI/live-path claims, also use `skills/verify/SKILL.md` to pick the prove command
(`control-invoker prove <feature>` / `doctor` / `owner query`) before writing done/shipped claims.

Use visible markdown sections for review metadata. Do not hide `Review Claim`, `Review Lane`, `Review Unit`, `Safety Invariant`, or `Slice Rationale` inside `<details>` or other HTML disclosure blocks. Review metadata must render directly in the PR body.

Test Plan and Revert Plan are the opposite: keep their `## Test Plan` / `## Revert Plan` headings visible, but their content must sit inside a collapsed `<details>` block with `<summary>Test Plan</summary>` / `<summary>Revert Plan</summary>`. `scripts/validate-pr-body.mjs` rejects a plan section whose content is not collapsed, and rejects the `open` attribute.

A check you did not run gets its own Test Plan row: `- Not run: <check>. Blocker: <what stops it>`. Run the check instead whenever you can; the row is only for a check something stops you from running, and the blocker names that thing, such as a missing API key or a host you cannot reach. `scripts/validate-pr-body.mjs` rejects a Test Plan row that starts `Not run:` unless `Blocker:` followed by text sits on that line or on the next non-empty line. The check reads only that labelled row; it does not judge whether the blocker is real, so that stays with the author and the reviewer.

CI validates the declared Review Lane and Review Unit against the actual changed files. Keep `behavior`, `refactor`, and `cleanup` slices separate from docs, policy, and proof files. Keep `proof` separate from product, docs, and policy files. Keep `policy` separate from product and proof files. Keep `docs` separate from product, policy, proof, and product-test files. The exact classification and review-unit boundaries live in `scripts/validate-pr-body.mjs` and `scripts/review-unit-rules.mjs`; split the PR when the local validator reports a mismatch.

When an existing PR changes after its body or proof was written, rerun this skill from the current diff before updating the PR. If the new diff touches UI-impacting files, rerun `skills/visual-proof/SKILL.md` and replace old screenshot or video links with fresh proof for the current code. Do not reuse earlier proof media after UI behavior changes.
Every PR body carries a visible `## Measured` section, placed after `## Test Plan`. It holds a `Command:` line naming the exact repro or benchmark command, then a `### Base` row and a `### Head` row, each with that command's pasted output in a fenced block. Paste the output the command printed, such as its timing line; a pass count or a sentence about the result is not a measurement. Run the command on the base commit and on this branch, and paste both. When the slice has nothing to measure, write `none: <reason>` in place of the rows. Do not put `## Measured` or its rows inside `<details>`; collapsed content does not count. `scripts/validate-pr-body.mjs` checks the section by its shape and warns when it is missing, collapsed, or has no pasted output under `### Base` or `### Head`. The warning becomes a failure only with `--require-measured`, because a hard requirement would fail the PR Body check on every PR that was already open.

Before writing any "Fixed"/"resolves"/"no longer happens" claim backed by a screenshot or video, actually open that exact media yourself — Read the image, or extract and Read video frames — in the same turn you write the claim. Do not trust an automated DOM/test assertion as a substitute for looking; a test passing proves the test's assertion, not that you looked at what the media shows. State precisely what you saw on a `Manually inspected:` line inside `## Visual Proof`. `scripts/validate-pr-body.mjs` rejects a Visual Proof section that has media but no `Manually inspected:` line. See `skills/prove-it/SKILL.md` for the full rule, including the same standard applied to live-system status claims.

Visual proof must show the changed behavior itself, not just the changed screen area. Before creating or updating the PR, open every screenshot or video and verify the user-visible target is present and identifiable. For conditional or event-driven UI, drive the exact condition that triggers the new state and capture that state. A generic task panel, unchanged sidebar, unrelated graph, or stale screenshot is not proof, even when the right file changed.

If the changed behavior spans multiple states or a state transition — for example restart persistence, before/after workflow transitions, progress animations, opening then dismissing overlays, or any proof labeled “before” and “after” — use animated proof. A gif, mp4, webm, or walkthrough video is required; static screenshots alone are not enough.

When the claim is that a state persists across an action — navigation, restart, refresh, resize — each screenshot must also show the action happened. Number the frames as a sequence and make every frame identify its step through an on-screen cue: the moved selection highlight, the changed route, or the swapped panel, with the preserved state unchanged beside it. Two frames that differ only in the preserved state do not prove the action occurred; if no on-screen cue distinguishes the steps, rely on the walkthrough video as the primary proof.

In the PR body, caption each visual proof item with the concrete thing the reviewer should see, for example "amber Workspace recreated notice in the task inspector." If the reviewer cannot tell what changed from the image and caption, recapture proof before publishing.

Before/after visual proof images must use distinct local filenames before `node scripts/create-pr.mjs` uploads them. The uploader keys media by basename inside one upload prefix, so `before/foo.png` and `after/foo.png` can collapse to one final URL. Copy or rename the files first, for example `/tmp/proof/foo-before.png` and `/tmp/proof/foo-after.png`, then put those unique paths in the PR body.

The final published PR body must not leave repo-relative proof paths in markdown. Use `node scripts/create-pr.mjs` so local proof files are uploaded or rewritten to published URLs before the PR is created or updated.

If the changed behavior is a cursor, pointer, hover-only affordance, or other state that a static screenshot cannot show, do not present an unchanged screenshot as proof of the behavior. Add a short video, an inspectable state proof, or a focused test reference, and say plainly why the screenshot alone cannot show it.

When a PR changes skill instructions under `skills/**/SKILL.md`, add or update a focused skill contract test for the exact issue being fixed. The test must fail if the instruction that prevents the regression is removed.

Do not default to a lightweight `## Summary / ## Testing / ## Notes` PR body. That shape is ad hoc drift, not the repo standard. Use `## Summary / ## Review Claim / ## Review Lane / ## Review Unit / ## Safety Invariant / ## Slice Rationale / ## Non-goals / ## Test Plan / ## Revert Plan` as the floor, keep Test Plan and Revert Plan content in their collapsed `<details>` blocks, add `## Visual Proof` for UI-impacting diffs, and add `## Architecture` when the change affects component interactions or data/control flow.

## Diff atomicity gate

`scripts/create-pr.mjs` computes changed files and a full-context diff, then runs `scripts/lint-pr-diff-atomicity.mjs` through the PR body checker before image upload, push, or GitHub mutation.

For Invoker stacked PRs, diff atomicity blockers are hard failures. Readability warnings like large file count stay warnings, but a stack slice that trips a diff-atomicity finding such as unrelated areas MUST be split before publication.

If one branch mixes behavior, refactor, cleanup, or test-harness/proof work, split the work into separate PRs. Do not relabel the lane or weaken the checker to make a mixed branch pass.

## Comment policy gate

Before publishing, run `pnpm run check:comments` (`scripts/check-added-comments.mjs`). It covers `.cjs`/`.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.py`/`.pyi`/`.sh`/`.ts`/`.tsx` and rejects any newly-added explanatory comment against this repo's Comment Policy (see root `CLAUDE.md`), including comments picked up from a cherry-picked or auto-generated commit. It also covers fenced code blocks (```js, ```ts, ```sh, ```py, and aliases) inside `skills/**/*.md`, so a skill's own example snippets follow the same policy — untagged or non-code fences (yaml, json, prose) are not scanned. It runs in CI as `quality / Added Comment Policy`, so a failure here after publishing still blocks the PR — check it locally first rather than discovering it from a red check.

## Command surface

Preferred repo-local flow:

1. Make sure the branch is based from the canonical base remote.
   Reference: `docs/pr-branching-workflow.md`
2. Push the working branch to the configured publish remote (typically `origin`).
3. Start from the canonical template and validate it:

```bash
cp scripts/pr-body-template.md /tmp/my-pr.md
$EDITOR /tmp/my-pr.md
node scripts/validate-pr-body-local.mjs --body-file /tmp/my-pr.md --base master
```

4. Create or update the PR with:

```bash
node scripts/create-pr.mjs --title "<title>" --base master --body-file /tmp/my-pr.md
```

After any branch update, rebase, force-push, or stacked-branch reshuffle, refresh the PR title and body so they still match the live diff. Re-check `## Summary`, test commands, revert guidance, and any visual proof section; old copy is stale the moment the branch meaning changes.

Update an existing PR with:

```bash
node scripts/create-pr.mjs --title "<title>" --base master --body-file /tmp/my-pr.md --update <pr-number>
```

For stacked PRs, `create-pr` also refreshes the machine-managed full-stack comment across every PR in the connected stack. The comment marks the target PR with `← this PR`.

For Mergify-managed stack PRs, this update path is REQUIRED after `mergify stack push`. Do not leave the Mergify-generated placeholder title/body live.
After `mergify stack push`, you MUST audit the live PRs immediately. Default Mergify-created titles/bodies like an empty description or a bare `Depends-On:` line are a publication failure, not a follow-up chore.

Required post-push audit:
No custom payload parsing is required here. The check is simple: verify the rendered title/body and the base/head branch names on each live PR.

1. Read each live PR (`gh pr view` or `pr://`) for title, body, base, and head.
2. If any PR is missing the preferred body sections or the aligned stack title prefix, repair it before yielding.
3. Prefer `node scripts/create-pr.mjs --update-existing ...` when the current local branch matches the published PR branch.
4. If Mergify generated a remote-only head branch name that `create-pr` cannot map from the local branch, first run `node scripts/validate-pr-body-local.mjs --body-file <file> --base <actual-base-branch>`, then use `gh pr edit --title ... --body-file ...` immediately rather than leaving placeholder metadata live.

Do not stop after `mergify stack push` until the GitHub-side metadata matches the intended titles and bodies.

This script handles local image path upload/injection when configured. It also rejects UI-impacting diffs unless the body includes visual proof media.

## Upstream-first workflow

Use the canonical repository as the PR target and an explicit publish remote (typically `origin`) for branch publication.

- Do not depend on fork-sync scripts before PR creation.
- Create branches from `<baseRemote>/<base>` (for example `origin/master` when `origin` is the canonical clone remote).
- Push branches to the chosen publish remote.
- Open PRs against the canonical repository base branch.

Reference:

- `docs/pr-branching-workflow.md`

## Invoker-specific publication rule

If the target repo is Invoker itself (`EdbertChan/Invoker` or `Neko-Catpital-Labs/Invoker`):

- use the preferred PR schema above
- keep stack publication explicit
- Invoker-on-Invoker review stacks should publish through the repo-local make-pr workflow, then use:

```bash
mergify stack push
```

Do not generalize this to unrelated repos.

### Run `mergify stack push` only from the working branch

Never run `mergify stack push` (including the `-k` update variant) while checked out on a Mergify-generated stack branch (`stack/<user>/<working-branch>/<slug>--<change-id>`). The real push does not fail safe there: instead of refusing, it can auto-switch to a stale leftover branch and publish an unrelated stack. This happened once — PR #3407 published accidental PRs #3408–#3411 from a leftover `tmp-rebase-fixsessions` branch.

- Push only from the working branch (for example `pr/<name>`), where the stack resolves as `<trunk>..HEAD`.
- Mergify stack bases must be the trunk branch or a live `stack/` branch. Never publish a Mergify stack with a `plan/` base: a separately landed stack PR does not retarget PRs based on that integration branch.
- This rule applies to Invoker dogfood and target repositories that independently use Mergify Stacks. It does not prohibit non-Mergify Invoker workflows from using `plan/` integration branches.
- Always preview with `mergify stack push --dry-run` first and confirm the plan pushes ONLY your intended commits. `--dry-run` refuses on a generated branch; the real push does not, so the dry-run is your safety check.
- To update ONE already-published branch, prefer `git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD` — it is deterministic and does no stack resolution.
- Use the guard `node scripts/safe-stack-push.mjs` (add `--execute` to push). It refuses on a generated branch and forces the dry-run preview before any real push.

## Stack repair after review

If review says one published stack slice is still too broad:

1. Re-run `skills/review-compression/SKILL.md`.
2. If one published slice must split, keep the shared idea and create lettered replacement titles such as `(4a)` and `(4b)`.
3. If the split creates a conflict-only, import-only, or other no-new-claim fixup slice, fold that fixup into the previous slice before publication.
4. Re-audit every rebuilt slice in the resulting stack, not just the PR that was flagged.
5. Run `mergify stack push`.
6. Switch to each generated stack branch.
7. Get the real base branch with `gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName`.
8. Update each PR with `node scripts/create-pr.mjs --title "..." --base <actual-base-branch> --body-file <file> --update-existing`.
9. After any stack reorder, replacement slice, or new top slice, rerun `create-pr --update-existing` on one published branch so the machine-managed stack comment is refreshed across the whole stack.

10. Audit the live PR metadata on GitHub. If any replacement PR still shows an empty description or only `Depends-On:`, repair it immediately.
Manual `gh pr edit` is the escape hatch when `create-pr --update-existing` cannot map the local branch to the published Mergify branch. Use it to repair live metadata immediately, not as the default path.


## Validation
- ensure the PR title still matches the current slice after any branch update or force-push
- ensure the `## Summary` section still describes the current diff, not the earlier version
- ensure the branch is pushed
- ensure the body sections are present and concrete
- ensure test commands are real commands that were actually run when possible
- give every Test Plan `Not run:` row a `Blocker:` naming what stops the check, or run the check and drop the row
- ensure revert guidance is honest
- keep Test Plan and Revert Plan content inside their collapsed `<details><summary>Test Plan</summary>` / `<summary>Revert Plan</summary>` blocks
- do not create, update, or Mergify-publish a PR when the branch has no file changes against its selected base or contains an empty commit slice; fix the branch history before using `node scripts/create-pr.mjs`, `node scripts/create-pr.mjs --update-existing ...`, or `mergify stack push`
- paste the repro or benchmark command's base and head output under a visible `## Measured` section, or write `none: <reason>`
- validate the body against the current branch diff with `node scripts/validate-pr-body-local.mjs --body-file <file> --base <base-branch>`
- run `pnpm run check:comments` and remove any newly-added comment it flags, including one carried in from a cherry-pick
- for stacked PRs, treat diff-atomicity blockers as fatal, even when readability-only warnings still print
- for stacked PRs, after any split or restack, re-audit the full rebuilt stack before publishing or updating PRs
- for stacked PRs, auto-fold conflict-only, import-only, or other no-new-claim fixup slices into the previous slice before publication
- for stacked PRs, update title/body through `node scripts/create-pr.mjs --update-existing ...`, not `gh pr edit`
- for stacked PRs, verify that `create-pr` refreshed the machine-managed full-stack comment across every PR in the stack
- for UI-impacting diffs, include `## Visual Proof` with screenshot or video proof before `node scripts/create-pr.mjs`; classify by user-visible behavior, not by path alone
If you include `## Architecture`, keep the diagrams renderable by GitHub Mermaid.
Always quote labels that contain prose, punctuation, or code-ish text such as `reviewGate.artifacts[]`.
