    All four "landed" signals are independent and OR'd by the policy layer:
    ancestry catches direct/rebase merges, empty-diff catches squash merges
    (the merged commits are never ancestors of master), and
    all_commits_equivalent catches per-commit reword/rebase onto master.
    is_rebase_equivalent catches a near-duplicate PR left behind when two
    open PRs independently add the same file and only one lands (the
    other's head still textually differs from master, so the first three
    signals all miss it, even though rebasing it would produce no change).
